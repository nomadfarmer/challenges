* Coding Challenges

A record of some of my solutions from coding challenges.

Challenges come from a variety of sources, including:
- Adventofcode.com
- hackerrank.com (I look forward to working through the project Euler set there)
- open.kattis.com
- codewars.com
- Miscellaneous puzzles from friends or elsewhere

* Update Summer 2023
Am I back to coding for fun? Only time will tell.
